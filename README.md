# Object_Tracking_CV
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on real-time object tracking using computer vision and deep learning. It leverages state-of-the-art object detection models (such as YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN) combined with tracking algorithms like SORT, DeepSORT, and ByteTrack to track objects across frames in video streams. 
## ðŸš€ Features 
âœ… Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) using deep learning models 
âœ… Supports YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN for object detection 
âœ… Implements SORT, DeepSORT, Kalman Filter & Hungarian Algorithm for tracking
âœ… Real-time processing using OpenCV and TensorFlow/PyTorch
âœ… Custom dataset support for training and evaluation 
âœ… Visualization tools for tracking path and bounding boxes
